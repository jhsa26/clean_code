python generator similar alternatives:
iteritems() vs items()
xrange() vs range()
benefits of using generator:

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a  # b is a reference on a, same object
b = a[:] # b is a swallow copy of a
b = list(a) # b is a swallow copy of a
import copy
b = copy.deepcopy(a) # b is a deep copy of a

a = [1, 2, 3]
a.insert(2, 4) # only update but no output
a[:2] + [4] + a[2:] # does not update the original array but make the output
similarly
b = [1, 2]
a.append(b) # append the [1, 2] to [1, 2, 3, [1, 2]]
a + b # does not update but output [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
a = a + b # does not output but update a to [1, 2, 3, 1, 2]

bit manipulation:
a ^ b: xor
a | b: or
a & b: and 
~ a: negate
a << 1 or a >> 1

from collections import deque
from collections import Counter

pay attention to python's pass by value/reference:
def temp(lis):
    lis.append(1)
    return lis

ans = [1, 2]
temp(ans)
ans

def temp(lis):
    lis = lis + [1]
    return lis

ans = [1, 2]
temp(ans)
ans

random.random
random.randint
random.choice
random.shuffle
random.uniform

collections.defaultdict
collections.deque
collections.counter

mysql allows:
group by with alias in select clause
select the column which is unique for each group by group by clause
which is not well supported by Oracle or sql server

git clone/init to local (firstly the repository already forked from other github account into my personal account)
then add a remote upstream as the original github account by tracking any changes:
git remote add upstream <account>
git fetch upstream <branch>
git branch -va
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master

do your own work by creating a new branch:
git checkout master
git branch newfeature
git checkout newfeature
.... do any editing or adding

rebase process if applicable:
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master

git checkout newfeature
git rebase master

to manage multiple github account within a certain computer:
we can directly add a line in the ~/.gitconfig:
[credential]
useHttpPath = true
then you will be prompted with the certain usename and password for different account every time you send pull or push
for different ssh keys to be setup for different account, refer to the online tutorial also.
